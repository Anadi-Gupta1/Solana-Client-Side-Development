# IDLs & Contract Interaction

## Overview
Master Interface Definition Languages (IDLs) and contract interaction patterns, comparing official clients vs custom parsing.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand IDL structure and generation
- Implement contract interaction patterns
- Compare official vs custom client approaches
- Parse account data efficiently

## IDL Fundamentals

### What are IDLs?
- Interface definitions for programs
- Type safety and code generation
- Development workflow integration

### IDL Structure
```json
// Example IDL structure will go here
```

### Code Generation
- TypeScript client generation
- Rust client generation
- Custom tooling

## Contract Interaction Patterns

### Official Clients
- Anchor-generated clients
- SPL program clients
- Metaplex clients

### Custom Parsing
- Manual account data parsing
- Performance considerations
- Flexibility vs convenience

## Account Data Parsing

### Structured Data
- Borsh deserialization
- Custom data layouts
- Version handling

### Dynamic Schemas
- Runtime schema detection
- Flexible parsing strategies
- Error handling

## Development Workflow

### IDL Management
- Version control
- Distribution strategies
- Update mechanisms

### Testing Patterns
- Client testing
- Integration testing
- Mock data generation

## Performance Considerations
- Client bundle size
- Parsing efficiency
- Caching strategies

## Code Examples
Explore `examples/` for IDL usage patterns and client implementations.

## Tools & Libraries
- Anchor framework
- Shank IDL generator
- Custom parsers

## Best Practices
- Type safety enforcement
- Error handling
- Documentation generation

## Next Steps
Advance to [Module 10: Borsh Serialization](../10-borsh-serialization/)
