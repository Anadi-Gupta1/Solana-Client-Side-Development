# Cryptography Fundamentals

## Overview
Deep dive into cryptographic concepts essential for blockchain development, focusing on hashing, encryption, and digital signatures.

## Learning Objectives
- Master cryptographic hashing functions
- Understand symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
- Learn public key cryptography principles
- Explore ECDSA and ED25519 curve implementations

## Key Topics

### üîê Hashing
- SHA-256, SHA-3, Blake2
- Merkle trees and proof systems
- Hash collisions and security

### üîë Encryption
- Symmetric encryption (AES)
- Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC)
- Key derivation functions

### ‚úçÔ∏è Digital Signatures
- ECDSA (secp256k1)
- ED25519 (Curve25519)
- Signature verification and security

## Practical Exercises
- Implement basic hashing functions
- Create and verify digital signatures
- Build simple encryption/decryption tools

## Code Examples
