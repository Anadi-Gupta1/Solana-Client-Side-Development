# Solana Accounts Model

## Overview
Comprehensive study of Solana's unique account model, including data accounts, PDAs, and program accounts.

## Learning Objectives
- Master Solana's account-based architecture
- Understand Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- Learn about different account types
- Implement account management patterns

## Account Types

### 1. Data Accounts
- User-owned accounts
- Token accounts
- Associated token accounts

### 2. Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)
- **Program Signing** - How programs sign transactions
- **Determinism** - Reproducible address generation
- Use cases and patterns

### 3. Program Accounts
- Executable accounts
- Program data storage
- Upgrade authorities

### 4. Program Data Accounts
- Separate data storage
- Upgrade mechanisms

## Key Concepts

### Account Structure
```rust
// Account data structure examples will go here
```

### Rent & Storage
- Rent exemption thresholds
- Account size considerations
- Storage optimization

### Ownership Models
- Program ownership
- User ownership
- Authority patterns

## Practical Examples
- Account creation and management
- PDA derivation examples
- Cross-program invocations

## Code Samples
